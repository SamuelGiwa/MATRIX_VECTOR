# Vector algebra visualization

## Project description

This project is a simple web-based application that visualizes operations on  vector algebra. The application allows users to input vectors and transformation matrices, and it dynamically draws the vectors and their transformations on a canvas element using HTML5 and JavaScript.


## Features

1. Draws two input vectors on a canvas.
2. Draws the resultant vector of the two input vectors.
3. Applies a 2x2 transformation matrix to a predefined vector and visualizes the transformed vector.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript (ES6)
